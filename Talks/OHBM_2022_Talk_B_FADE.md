**Abstract:** Human cognitive abilities typically decline with increasing chronological age, with explicit memory performance being particularly affected. In order to track such developments, and especially to differentiate healthy physiological from patho-physiological aging, predictors of this decline need to be identified. Whereas previous studies on age-related differences have focused on just a few potential predictors, we here compared behavioral data, task-based, resting-state and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in terms of their ability to predict chronological age and memory performance in two large samples of young (N = 106) and older (N = 153) adults.
